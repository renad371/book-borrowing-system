# Book Borrowing System - Laravel

## Overview
This project is a **Book Borrowing System** developed using **Laravel**. It includes multiple features such as authentication, Blade components, AJAX functionality, data tables, PDF export, role and permission management, morph relations for comments and ratings, and admin management.

## Features and Implementation Details

### 1. Authentication (Login & Registration)
The system provides authentication features, enabling users to log in and register securely.

### 2. Blade Components
Where Implemented: Three distinct Blade components were created:
- **Alert Component**: The alert component is used to display error messages in case of login or registration failures. This appears on the Login and Register pages (resources/views/auth).
- **Book Card**: Displays details of a book, such as title, author, and availability. Used in the `book.index.blade.php` view.
- **Author Card**: Displays author details with a card layout, used in the `author.index.blade.php` view.

**Description**: Components were designed for reusable UI elements to ensure consistency and modularity across the project.

### 3. AJAX Functionality
Where Implemented:
- **Borrowing Books**: Used AJAX to dynamically update the borrow status of books (book.blade.php).
- **Editing and Updating Information**: Used AJAX for updating book and user information (dashboard.author.index.blade.php, dashboard.books.index.blade.php).
- **Evaluation**: AJAX is used to submit book ratings and feedback without reloading the page.

**Description**: AJAX was implemented to enhance user experience by dynamically updating the content without requiring a full page reload.

### 4. Data Tables (AJAX)
Where Implemented: Data tables are used to display lists of books, borrowings, and authors in different sections:
- **Viewing Borrowings**: Data table for displaying borrow records in the admin panel (`user.borrowed_books.blade.php`).
- **Books Management**: Data table for managing books and their details in the admin panel (`dashboard.books.index.blade.php`).
- **Authors Management**: Data table for viewing and managing author information in the admin panel (`dashboard.author.index.blade.php`).

**Description**: The data tables allow for sorting, searching, and pagination with dynamic data loading through AJAX.

### 5. PDF Export
Where Implemented: PDF export feature is implemented to export a list of books that the user has borrowed (`user.borrowed_books.blade.php`).

### 6. Role & Permission Management
Where Implemented: Role and permission management is implemented using the [Spatie/laravel-permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission) package.

**Description**: The system defines two primary roles:
- **Admin**: Can add, edit, and delete books.
- **User**: Can borrow books and evaluate authors and books.

### 7. Morph Relations (Comments & Ratings)
Where Implemented: The morph relation is used for comments and ratings, allowing users to comment or rate either a book or an author.

**Description**: This relationship makes it possible for users to dynamically comment on or rate books or authors. The comments and ratings are stored in a shared table with a morph relation linking to either the Book or Author models.
